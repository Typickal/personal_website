# Personal Website

This my personal resume website hosted on Netlify. The website is a simple, single HTML page with embedded CSS and JavaScript. It was inspired by a Linux terminal!

## How It Works

- The website is built as a **single HTML file**.
- **CSS** is embedded within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section.
- **JavaScript** is embedded within the `<script>` tags, allowing for dynamic interaction and functionality on the page.
  
## Hosting

The website is hosted on **Netlify** for easy deployment and continuous hosting.
